# MC-Factions
Minecraft plugin with basic factions implementation and custom commands
This project was made for my Boy Scout Troop to play on during the lockdowns due to COVID. Each patrol was given a faction through the plugin.
Factions can claim and steal land based on their strength, as well as set home locations to teleport to.
Many commands were added in order for players to use faction actions. Some extra commands and items were also added for personal testing and gameplay enhancement.
